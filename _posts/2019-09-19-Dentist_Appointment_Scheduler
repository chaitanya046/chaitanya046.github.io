Scenario -
The clinic has two doctors, a General Dentist & a Pediatric Dentist. Both have their separate calendars. Our clinic has only one dental chair.
So, appointments should be booked in a systematic way via WPF application.
The clinic has an admissions clerk (secretary), responsible for managing the appointments and filling the patients' information.

In this project we designed an WPF app to schedule appointments for patients. The app runs on local machine and has a WPF user interface.
The admin can add and schedule appointments based on patient info. various parameters are used to filter the results and display the upcoming schedules on a table.
Patients with specific medical conditions are highlighted.
Patients with age lower than age threshold are given priority in the queue.
